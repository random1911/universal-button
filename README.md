# What is this?

This is my thoughts on the button component when using the CCS in a classic global scope. After years working with AngularJS and extremely creative designers, this example shows the power of React to make flexible components for multiple cases.

So button can play different roles.

First, button can be just button - `<button>` for handle some `onClick` actions

Second, it can be a link with button styles, so it has to be anchor `<a>` or router`<Link>`

And third, it can be a label associated with file input, for example.
